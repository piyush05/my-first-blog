            <p>We waved goodbye to the Nexus 5 when Google stopped selling its 2014 flagship Android smartphone earlier this year, but it might be time to say hello to a revamped version. Rumors in May suggested that Google was working with partners Huawei and LG to produce two new Nexus phones â€” a 5.7-inch Huawei device, and a 5.2-inch model with the Korean manufacturer. Now, thanks to a leaked photo tweeted by video producer and friend of The Verge Marques Brownlee, we might have our first glimpse of the new Nexus 5 in the wild.</p>
